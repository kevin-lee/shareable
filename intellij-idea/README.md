# IntelliJ IDEA

## templates
Add the `xml` files in the `templates` folder to your IntelliJ IDEA's `templates` folder.
e.g.)

For macOS, it might be like
```
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2023.1/templates"
```

If you're using settings repository, it may look like this.
```
"$HOME/Library/Application Support/JetBrains/IntelliJIdea2023.1/settingsRepository/repository/templates"
```

If you don't have `templates` in your IntelliJ IDEA folder, please create it first.
